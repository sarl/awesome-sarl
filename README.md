Awesome SARL
============

A community driven list of useful [SARL](http://www.sarl.io) libraries, frameworks and software. This is not a catalog of all the libraries, just a starting point for your explorations. This list will be used by the SARL team for updating the official web sites of SARL (and related) after a validation process. Inspired by [awesome-scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala). Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in the [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) list.

## SARL Frameworks

*Development frameworks dedicated to SARL.*

* [Eclipse](https://github.com/sarl/sarl) — The SARL project supports integration in the Eclipse IDE.

## Runtime Environments

*Runtime environments for the SARL language.*

* [Janus](http://www.janusproject.io) — An open-source multi-agent platform fully implemented in Java 1.7, and that enables execution of agents or holons over a computer network.

* [Eclipse](https://github.com/sarl/sarl) — The SARL project supports integration in the Eclipse IDE.

## News and Documentation

*Locations where to find news and documentation.*

* [FAQ from RMIT Lab](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/ssardina/9er67X#markdown-header-intialize-behavior-in-agents-do-not-terminate) — FAQ written by Sebastian Sardina at RMIT lab, Australia.
* [SARL News](http://www.sarl.io/news/index.html) — The news from SARL developpers.
* [SARL Documentation](http://www.sarl.io/docs/index.html) — Official SARL documentation.
* [SARL Publications](http://www.sarl.io/publications/index.html) — A collection of white papers and presentations related to SARL.

## Language Extensions

*Language extensions upon the SARL language.*

## Simulation Environments

*Libraries that provides simulation environments to SARL agents.*

* [SARL Elevator Simulator Controller](https://bitbucket.org/sarlrmit/sarl-controller) — Project that enables to connect controllers written in SARL to an existing elevator simulator with specific skills.
* [Jaak](https://github.com/gallandarakhneorg/jaak) — Jaak is an agent environment that provides a discrete 2D environment model and a simplified agent-environment interaction model based on LOGO-like primitives. License: Apache 2.
* [Jasim](http://www.multiagent.fr/Jasim_Platform) — A non-free Java library that implements simulated 1D and 3D physic environments in which the agents are located. License: Non-free, need agreement.

## Applications

*Software implemented with SARL.*

* [smagserver](https://github.com/scenaristeur/smagserver) - A small project that could serve as a template for deploying Janus on a webserver. License: unknown. Using Jena, Janus & HTML5.
Demo at [Smag0](http://smag-smag0.rhcloud.com/)

## Teaching Materials

*Slides and presentations for Lectures to students*
* [Chapters 3 & 11](http://www.multiagent.fr/images/IA54_3_11.pdf) of the Lecture "Distributed Artificial Intelligence and MultiAgent Systems", Burgundy Franche-Comté University & University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard, France.

*Code and elements for using SARL during teaching activities (lab works, etc.)*
